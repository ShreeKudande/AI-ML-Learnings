#Q. Take two numbers as input from the user and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

num1 = int(input("Enter the 1st Number : "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the 2nd Number : "))

print("The sum is ", num1+num2)
print("The difference is ", num1-num2)
print("The product is ", num1*num2)
print("The quotient is ", num1/num2)

# Enter the 1st Number : 6
# Enter the 2nd Number : 6
# The sum is  12
# The difference is  0
