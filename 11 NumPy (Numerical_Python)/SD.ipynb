    "# Standard Deviation (SD)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Deviation** measures how spread out numbers in a dataset are from the average (mean). It essentially tells you how \"concentrated\" the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low SD:** Data points cluster tightly near the mean (indicates stability/consistency).\n",
    "* **High SD:** Data points are spread widely from the mean (indicates volatility/unpredictability).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** SD is the square root of the variance. This returns the metric to the **original units** of the data (e.g., dollars, meters), making it much easier to interpret than variance (which is in squared units).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low SD Example:** Consistent test scores (e.g., 88, 90, 92).\n",
    "* **High SD Example:** Fluctuating stock prices (e.g., $50, $120, $30).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Units:** If your data is in *meters*, Variance is in $m^2$, but Standard Deviation returns to *meters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Risk Assessment:** Used in finance to quantify investment volatility (risk).\n",
    "2.  **Quality Control:** Used by businesses to monitor product consistency.\n",
    "3.  **Data Analysis:** Helps determine if data is clustered around a central value or dispersed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Calculate It\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation differs slightly depending on whether you have a whole population or just a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Formula (Sample SD):**\n",
    "$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n - 1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step:**\n",
    "1.  **Find the Mean ($\\bar{x}$):** Calculate the average of your data set.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate Deviations:** Subtract the mean from each individual data point $(x_i - \\bar{x})$.\n",
    "3.  **Square Deviations:** Square each result to remove negative values.\n",
    "4.  **Sum Squares:** Add up all the squared deviations.\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Variance:** Divide by $n-1$ (for a sample) or $N$ (for a population).\n",
    "6.  **Find SD:** Take the square root of the variance to get the final Standard Deviation."
